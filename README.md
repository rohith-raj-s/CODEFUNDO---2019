# CODEFUNDO---2019

Authority deciding who can vote must be outside the chain. Diffrent rules under diffrent categories. 
The identity can be stored on chain to verify (to prevent multiple registrations or fradulent registrations further on same)
Once verified token is given to them to vote exactly once.

voting platform is a mobile app or website that verifies the identity and token (as both must be there on the chain having any one of them cant be used to vote)
Voting platform should be open source so that anyone can check the funtioning of the process/application.

voter is asked in the app multiple times(example 3) to confirm the choice by the user. as once submitted change is not allowed.

The voting period is open for a particular time period and all voting must be done within the stipulated time period. Once voting time period is completed. The results of the voting should be out within a time period (prevents unncessary delay unlike manual counting and can be used as a standard to tell if the results are legitimate apart from security provided by blockchain through hashing)
